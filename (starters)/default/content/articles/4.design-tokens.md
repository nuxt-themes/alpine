# Customize Alpine

Leverage the `tokens.config.ts` to give your identity to Alpine.

Look at the [default tokens config](https://github.com/nuxt-themes/alpine/tree/dev/tokens.config.ts) to check all the Alpine related Design Tokens.

Alpine is also powered by [@nuxt-themes/tokens](https://github.com/nuxt-themes/tokens).

You can configure all the theme tokens to change the apperance of Alpine.
