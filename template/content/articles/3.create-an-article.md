# Create an article

To create a new article, create a new Markdown file in the `content/articles` directory:

```bash
touch content/articles/1.my-new-article.md
```

## Display the article in the list

For your article to be correctly displayed in the [articles list](/articles), define a `cover` and `date` property in the frontmatter:

```yaml [content/articles/1.my-new-article.md]
---
cover: path/to/cover
date: 2022-08-23
---
```

The `cover` property can be a local path relative to the `/public` directory or an external URL.

Your article will now be displayed in the list with its filename as a default title.

## Edit your article

Under the frontmatter block, enter a Markdown `h1` tag and a line of text:

```md [content/articles/1.my-new-article.md]
---
cover: path/to/cover
date: 2022-08-23
---

# An awesome article

This article is little by size but big by heart.
```

Your article will now be displayed in the list with the title and description you wrote in Markdown.

## Override title and description

If you want to change the title and description displayed on the list and in the meta tags of the article, add the `title` and `description` property to your frontmatter:

```md[content/articles/1.my-new-article.md]
---
cover: path/to/cover
date: 2022-08-23
title: Another title
description: Another description
---
```
